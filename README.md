<h2 align="center">"My Journey: From Project Passion to GitHub Action 🚀"</h2>

Throughout my college years, I found myself gravitating toward a passion that few of my peers truly understood: making projects. While most of my classmates were buried in textbooks, mastering data structures and algorithms, I was off in my own world, dreaming up creative projects. From day one, it wasn’t the theory that fascinated me, but the thrill of actually building something! 🤖💻

  <summary><b>##🕵️‍♂️ Hey folks! Want to dive deeper into my epic tale? Click here! 📖</b></summary>
     
I’ll never forget that first orientation session. It was my first glimpse into what college life had in store, and more importantly, it’s where I first heard the magical words: **placement drives**. 🚀 Apparently, when you went for job interviews, it wasn’t just about how well you could recite algorithmic solutions—projects mattered, too! And I was like, “Wait, projects? That’s my jam!” 🎉 So, I quickly realized this love for projects could actually be a huge advantage. Score! 🏆

From that moment on, I became the project-making machine. 🤖 In every semester, with every subject, there was always a Continuous Assessment (CA) that needed completing. And guess what? I was there, front and center, brainstorming new ways to turn even the most mundane assignments into a project that would catch someone’s eye. 💡 By the time I hit my final year (aka the **boss level**), where you had to complete a major project, I was ready for it. I’d already trained for this my whole college life. 🎯

The crazy thing? People noticed. Even though I was pretty new to coding back then (read: I was still figuring out why semicolons are so important 🤦‍♂️), I somehow managed to score well in all my subjects, and my professors appreciated my efforts. Yup, I was living that “straight A's while winging it” life. 😎 But hold up, it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Behind my confident exterior, there was this *tiny little* problem… 

I was scared. Like, really scared. 🫣 I didn’t have the guts to share my projects with the world. While everyone else was happily posting their GitHub links like badges of honor, I was sitting there, quietly thinking, “What if they think it’s trash?” 🚮 So, yeah, I basically locked those projects away like they were some top-secret files, only showing them to my invigilators. If there was a “Project Vault” award, I would've won it hands down. 🏅

And so, time went on. I kept making more projects (I couldn’t stop—what can I say, it’s an addiction at this point 😜), but I never really shared them. Fast forward to today—I've completed my B.Tech, moved on with life, and *somehow* lost track of most of my earlier projects. 🙃 But recently, something pretty cool happened. I stumbled upon a few of them that I’d saved on my old laptop. 🖥️ Cue the nostalgia!

And then it hit me: *Why on earth was I hiding these?* 😳 Sure, they were simple, but so what? They were part of my journey, and every project told a story of how much I’d grown. Plus, it felt like a waste just letting them gather dust on my hard drive. So, I made a bold decision: I’m going to put them out there, on GitHub, one by one. 💪 

Let’s be real—some of them are basic AF 😅, but that’s okay! At the time, I was learning, experimenting, and trying out new things. I had projects from all sorts of areas—some were coding-based, others were, well, let's just say I even dipped into life sciences at one point 🧬. It was a wild ride. 🚴‍♂️

Now, I’ve started going through them again, bit by bit, reminiscing on what I did, tweaking a little here and there, and then proudly posting them online. 🎉 *Finally*! It’s funny—what I once saw as a fear is now more like a fun trip down memory lane, filled with learning curves, late nights, and lots of trial and error. My projects may have started small, but now they’re out there, ready to inspire someone else.

So yeah, here I am, sharing my journey. If I could go back and tell my younger self anything, it would be: *Dude, stop overthinking it! Just hit that publish button already!* 😜

<b>Note: </b>Right now, I'm on a mission to get all my old projects up on GitHub. 🚀 One by one, I'll be revisiting each project, adding detailed comments to explain it line by line, and then pushing the updated versions back onto GitHub. This way, it'll be way easier for anyone checking them out to understand what's going on. 📚💻
